# AngularJS Routing Error Fix

## Error Description
```
[$location:nobase] http://errors.angularjs.org/1.7.9/$location/nobase
```

This error occurs when AngularJS routing is configured with HTML5 mode but the application doesn't have a proper base href tag or is running from a file:// URL.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by:
1. Using `ngRoute` module with HTML5 mode enabled
2. Running the application from `file://` protocol (opening HTML directly in browser)
3. Missing base href configuration for HTML5 mode

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Routing Dependency
Since this is a single-page application that doesn't need URL routing, I removed the routing entirely:

**Before:**
```javascript
angular.module('resumeBuilderApp', ['ngRoute'])
    .config(configFunction)
```

**After:**
```javascript
angular.module('resumeBuilderApp', [])
```

### 2. Removed angular-route.min.js Script
**Before:**
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.9/angular-route.min.js"></script>
```

**After:**
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```

### 3. Simplified App Configuration
**Before:**
```javascript
configFunction.$inject = ['$routeProvider', '$locationProvider'];
function configFunction($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {
    $routeProvider.when('/', {...}).otherwise({...});
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
angular.module('resumeBuilderApp', [])
    .run(['$rootScope', function($rootScope) {
        console.log('Resume Builder App initialized');
    }]);
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **No Routing Needed**: The Resume Builder is a single-page application that uses view switching with `ng-show`/`ng-hide` instead of URL routing
2. **Eliminates Base Href Issues**: By removing routing, we avoid the need for base href configuration
3. **File Protocol Compatible**: The app now works when opened directly from the file system
4. **Simpler Architecture**: Reduces complexity and potential points of failure

## Files Modified

1. `/js/app.js` - Removed routing configuration
2. `/index.html` - Removed angular-route.min.js script
3. `/debug.html` - Removed angular-route.min.js script

## Testing

The application now:
- ✅ Loads without routing errors
- ✅ Works from file:// protocol
- ✅ Maintains all functionality (forms, preview, PDF download)
- ✅ Uses view switching instead of routing for navigation

## Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

If routing was actually needed, these alternatives could have been used:

1. **Add Base Href Tag:**
   ```html
   <base href="/">
   ```

2. **Disable HTML5 Mode:**
   ```javascript
   $locationProvider.html5Mode(false);
   ```

3. **Use Hash-based Routing:**
   ```javascript
   $locationProvider.html5Mode(false).hashPrefix('');
   ```

However, since the application doesn't need URL routing, removing it entirely was the best solution.

## Result

The application now loads without errors and all functionality works as expected:
- Form data binding ✅
- Real-time preview ✅
- PDF download ✅
- localStorage persistence ✅
- Responsive design ✅
